this is a simple shell project which made to execute commands
these commands are between (direct commands, aliases, and options)
the shell is working both:

1- interactive mode which is infinite and doesn't stop untill exiting.
2- non-interactive mode which only takes one command, execute it and terminate.

most of commands and programs inside the PATH files works well
as the program is using the path files to find the programs to execute.
